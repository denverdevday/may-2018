    <p class="text-justify">Welcome to Denver Dev Day, Colorado's premier, local community-organized 
    developer event. With presentation topics ranging from desktop, micro-services, and web development 
    to patterns, the cloud, and soft skills, Denver Dev Day is your awesome, free, day-long resource for 
    developer learning.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Microsoft continues to sponsor Denver Dev Day in 2018 with their killer 
    Denver Tech Center venue, while old and new event sponsors continue to back this good work.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Tell your manager it's time to sharpen the saw. Tell your manager when you 
    get smarter the business gets better. Tell your manager May 4<sup>th</sup> (it's a Friday) is on 
    your calendar and the whole development team is coming to Denver Dev Day. And, if you are working 
    on neat technology that you could share with other developers in our developer community, 
    step up&nbsp;&ndash; let this year be the year you submit a talk to Denver Dev Day.</p>

    <h2>Provide Sponsorship</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">Denver Dev Day is free, open to the public, and packed with 
    practical training and information on software development. We anticipate around 200 
    attendees from our local and national communities. Denver Dev Day will have several 
    tracks with various professional speakers and respected, community leaders. It will be 
    held on at the Microsoft Offices in the Denver Technology Center, a campus that is 
    friends with the developer community.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The success of Denver Dev Day is, in part, due to our sponsors. 
    For a cash or in-kind donation, your company or group can enjoy excellent exposure to 
    a segment of your target audience. We take it seriously to give your organization the 
    exposure you deserve in front of the best, local audience anyone could muster.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Denver Dev Day cash sponsorship is handled via PayPal. For more 
    information, please contact Daren May, the Denver Dev Day sponsorship manager at
    <a href="mailto:daren@custommayd.com">daren@custommayd.com</a> Please note that Denver Dev Day is 
    not a not-for-profit. As a result, we cannot provide your organization with a tax-related 
    receipt. We can, however, provide a standard receipt and our gratitude.</p>
